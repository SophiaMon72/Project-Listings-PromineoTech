This project allows you to create multiple projects and store them in a database. You can add a project, list your projects, select a project to interact with, update a project, and delete a project.

I used Java and DBeaver for this project.

As the project went on through the weeks, it became more complicated. Getting to add the last two options, update and delete, was tough, but it was fun to do! I felt very accomplished when I was finally able to get my code to work.

This project should be pretty easy to set up and replicate.

This code was completed with the help of Promineo Tech
